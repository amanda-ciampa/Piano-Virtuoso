# Piano Virtuoso

## What is it?

Piano Virtuoso is an education video game that teaches its players how to play piano and read music. Using lessons that increase in difficulty, the player is both challenged and engaged at all times. Each lesson features several mini games that cohere with a particular lesson to create a fun aspect while learning.

Piano Virtuoso is designed for all ages; anyone who wishes to learn how to play piano can! All that is needed is a MIDI controller to start a musical journey.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help install and run this program. 

### Prerequisites
